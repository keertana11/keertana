         		<h3>What is Online Auction ?</h3>

            

         	</div>
         	<div class="answer">
         		<p>An online auction is similar to our regular live auctions except that it is conducted entirely over the internet. In effect, the software system is taking the place of auctioneer in controlling the bidding and closing of the lots being sold.

If u have previously registered you can enter your username and password and proceed with registering for the auction. If this is your first time registering you will be asked to provide personal information and register either a visa or mastercard on the signup page.

         	<div class="question">
         		<h3>How do I bid?</h3>

         		

         	</div>
         	<div class="answer">
         		<p>Each lot in the auction has a clearly marked bidding window. One you are registered into the auction there are two ways to bid.
         		</p>
         		<p>1)	You simply indicate the maximum amount you wish to bid in the window where indicated and click on the ? place Bid ? button. You will be taken to a conformation screen that will ask you to either ? confirm Bid ? or ? cancel Bid ?. If you have not yet logged in you will be asked to do so in order to confirm your bid. Please note that by conforming your bid you are entering into a legally bidding contract with the auction house to pay for your successful bids plus the applicable buyer premium and taxes.
         		</p>
         		<p>2)	Bid in realtime as each lot is closing just like our live auction. You will be required to bid, and confirm your bid, for each increment that you are advancing. In effect, you are taking the same steps as in the method above, but are not disclosing your maximum. You are doing the work instead of relaying on the software.
