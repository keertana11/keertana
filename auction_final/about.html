	<p class="m-3">Online Auction System is an online platform where a user will be able to post items online for auction. The items will accompany item name, selling price, and a picture presentation for the bidder to see. The bidder, if interested in the item, will auction for the product and will be able to inspect the item physically to approve the product then complete the business with the seller. 
This is important since the auctioneer does not necessarily need to make a physical consultation with the seller for him/her to get the required services. The auctioneer will have a provision to chat with the seller and consult with him about the details of the product. This chat will be confidential only between the buyer and the seller, ensuring the buyerÂ’s confidentiality. The customers will be assured of getting the right products, since they will take their time to analyses and compare a range of listed items and choose appropriately according to their need or desire. This will save time that buyers take in search of items and therefore they will save themselves from worsening of conditions which may lead to wastage of time conditions. This will also save money that is spend around travelling and bidding for the undesired items. Bidders will at the end of the day have a reason to smile with this online system.
